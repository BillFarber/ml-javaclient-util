## Archive notice

This repository has been archived as the code has been migrated to the 
[ml-gradle repository](https://github.com/marklogic/ml-gradle/tree/dev/ml-javaclient-util) as part of the 
ml-gradle 5.0.0 release. 

The [Wiki pages in this repository](https://github.com/marklogic/ml-javaclient-util/wiki) are still valid as 
documentation but may soon be folded into the ml-gradle documentation.
